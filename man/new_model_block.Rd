\usage{
new_model_block(
  model_type = "lm",
  response = character(),
  predictors = character(),
  intercept = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_type}{Model type: "lm" (linear), "logistic" (logistic regression),
"poisson" (Poisson regression), "gamma" (Gamma regression)}

\item{response}{Response variable column name (single column)}

\item{predictors}{Predictor variable column names (can be multiple)}

\item{intercept}{Logical. Include intercept term in the model (default TRUE)}

}
\value{
A transform block object of class \code{model_block} that outputs
a model object.
}
\description{
Fit statistical models including linear models (lm), generalized linear
models (glm), and more. This block takes a data frame as input and outputs
a model object that can be consumed by downstream diagnostic blocks.
